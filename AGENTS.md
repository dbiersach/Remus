# Remus Project Rules and Python Style Guide

Remus is a chess engine written in pure, native Python as a teaching project for the
**"Turning a Chess Engine into Science AI"** workshop. The workshop has four engines in
the top `engines_instructor/` folder: Remus1, a random legal mover that ends Day 1, and Remus2,
Remus3, and Remus4;
[`docs/engines/remus_versions.md`](docs/engines/remus_versions.md) lists what each
one adds, and [`workshop_syllabus.md`](workshop_syllabus.md)
holds the plan of the five days.

This file holds every project and style rule, so that every AI tool used with this
repository builds Remus the same way. `CLAUDE.md` imports it and adds only the rules
that are specific to Claude Code. The Python style follows David's course repositories
(qis101, scicomp101, cse101), adapted for a chess engine and for students meeting its
ideas for the first time.

# Part 1: The project

## Why the name "Remus"

- **Sargon (1978)** was the landmark microcomputer chess program by Dan and Kathe
  Spracklen. Written in Z80 assembly for the Wavemate Jupiter II, it won the first
  microcomputer chess tournament (West Coast Computer Faire, 1978) with a perfect 5-0.
  Its complete source was published as a book, *Sargon: A Computer Chess Program*
  (Hayden, 1978), so people could read and learn from a real engine. It spawned Sargon II,
  2.5, III (ported to the first Macintosh), and later commercial versions.
- **Sargon of Akkad** (c. 2335 to 2279 BC, middle chronology) founded the Akkadian Empire,
  the first known great empire. He was succeeded by his sons **Rimush** (c. 2279 to 2270
  BC), who put down widespread revolts and was possibly assassinated by courtiers, and then
  **Manishtushu** (c. 2270 to 2255 BC), who campaigned south along the Tigris and into the
  Persian Gulf. Manishtushu's son Naram-Sin brought the empire to its height.
- **Remus** echoes **Rimush**, the first son and heir of Sargon. The engine is meant to be
  a "son of Sargon": an heir to that tradition of small, readable chess programs whose
  internals are laid open for learners, rebuilt in modern Python.
- The name leaves room for the family line: a later, stronger engine could take the name
  of the next heir (Manishtushu) or grandson (Naram-Sin).

## Project goals

- Build a legal chess engine that plays well, in code a student can read line by line.
- A working game comes first; stronger play comes later.
- Success means a learner can explain a move, say why a search result is legal and
  preferred, and say what each enhancement of Remus3 and Remus4 buys.

## Audience and workshop format

- Remus is an instructional engine for a **one-week, five-day workshop** taught to
  **students who know some coding and know how to play chess, including notation**
  (David, 2026-11-04): four 90-minute periods a day (8:30 to 10:00, 10:30 to 12:00,
  1:00 to 2:30, 3:00 to 4:30). Many students have learned Java, close enough to type
  Python and follow the ideas. Each engine carries the number of the day that
  builds it (David, 2026-11-03): Day 1 types in Remus1, Day 2 Remus2, Day 3 Remus3,
  Day 4 Remus4, and Day 5 is the science project.
- **The workshop is open to students of all ages** (David, 2026-11-04). Every
  document, comment, and brief names the audience with the plain word "students":
  no age, grade, school level, or age group.
- 20 students work in **10 student pairs** (driver and navigator, swapping every
  period). Each student pair gets an identical, preconfigured **Windows 11** class
  laptop with VS Code and Lucas Chess. Remus targets Windows only (David, 2026-10-28):
  the repository holds no Mac or Linux launchers or setup scripts.
- **Students type the engines in** (David, 2026-11-03). On Days 1 and 2 each
  student pair types in Remus1 and then Remus2, copying the instructor's version
  systematically, file by file. Later the student pairs type the new lines of Remus3
  and then of Remus4 the same way. The workshop has no Python skills labs and no
  unplugged (non-coding) activities.
- **Always minimize the code students type** (David, 2026-11-03). The engines hold
  no test, check, perft, or print code beyond what UCI needs: they "assume it works",
  and the workshop designer's `admin/verify_engines.py` checks them from
  outside. Prefer the shorter of two equally clear forms.
- Students know how the pieces move. Lessons remind them of the rarer rules right
  before the code that needs each one: castling conditions, en passant, promotion,
  stalemate, threefold repetition, the fifty-move rule, and insufficient material.
- The teacher writes no code during the workshop (David, 2026-10-31): every line a
  student pair does not type is already in the repository.
- Write code, comments, and lesson text for a student reading the idea for the first
  time: short functions, concrete names, and one small example position per idea.
- The class never builds a GUI. Every laptop uses **Lucas Chess** (David,
  2026-10-27), which runs Remus as a UCI engine through `remus.bat`.
  [`docs/lucas_chess/lucas_chess_guide.md`](docs/lucas_chess/lucas_chess_guide.md) shows
  students, step by step with screenshots, how to add Remus and watch it play
  Stockfish at 1500 Elo.
- **No GitHub for students.** Students create no online accounts: cloning the public
  repository needs none.
- **git and `uv` only at setup** (David, 2026-10-29). On Day 1, period 1, the teacher
  walks each student through installing git and `uv`, cloning the repository, and
  running `uv sync` once to build `.venv`. After that setup no student or teacher uses
  git or `uv` at any point in the workshop: no fetch, branch, commit, restore, or
  clone, and no `uv run`. Code never moves between laptops through git: on Day 5
  each student copies the Remus folder, without `.venv`, to a USB drive in File
  Explorer to take home. Never plan a step that needs a student account, pushes
  student code online, or asks a student or teacher to type a git or `uv` command
  after setup.
- **Three people use the repository** (David, 2026-10-29), and every document names
  the right one:
  - **Students**, the student pairs, who type in Remus1, Remus2, Remus3, and Remus4.
  - **Teachers**, who run the class. A teacher does everything in VS Code: open a
    file and press the Run Python File button, or open a Markdown page. No step of the
    five-day workshop asks a student or a teacher to type a command.
  - **The workshop designer** (David), who builds the workshop. The tools in
    `admin/` are designer tools, and only they may need `uv run` in a
    terminal.
- Documents describe the workshop as it stands, with no dates of past events ("the
  league finished on 2026-10-28", "a survey from October 2026"), the same rule as
  for code comments. The David dates in this file record when a rule was set and
  stay here only.

## Hard rules for the engine code

1. **Clarity over speed.** Plain lists, tuples, dicts, and functions. Slow is fine,
   but the engine copies a position instead of undoing a move because the copy is both
   shorter and faster.
2. **No third-party libraries inside the engine.** Standard library only. No bitboards,
   magic numbers, compiled extensions, or framework machinery.
3. **Engine is the single source of truth** for board, rules, legal moves, search,
   evaluation, and move choice. A GUI only sends moves and displays results.
4. **`python-chess` and Lucas Chess are boundary tools only.** Lucas Chess is the
   desktop GUI, which runs Remus over UCI. `python-chess` serves as an external
   cross-check in `verify_engines.py`, never as the engine's hidden implementation.
5. **Copy-make.** `make_move()` copies the board and returns a new position; no code
   changes a board in place, so the search never takes a move back and the live
   position stays unchanged even when the search stops early.
6. **Each version is the one before plus its enhancements.** Remus3 is Remus2 plus the
   steps that `remus_versions.md` gives Remus3, and Remus4 is Remus3 plus every other
   step. Keep the shared code identical from version to version, so a student pair
   types only the new lines. A change to a shared line goes into every version that
   holds it. Remus1 is the one exception: Remus2 replaces its 14-line `search.py`.
7. **Rules before search.** Move generation must match the published perft counts
   before any search change is trusted.
8. The opening book is a boundary feature. Validate every book move with the native
   generator; an absent book must never stop play.

## Representation conventions

- Board: a list of 64 numbers, one per square. A piece is its kind, from 1 for a pawn
  to 6 for a king, plus 8 if it is White (`WHITE = 8`), so `piece & 7` gives the kind
  and 0 is an empty square.
- **Coordinates: row 0 is rank 8, column 0 is file `a`,** and square number
  `row * 8 + col` names a square: a8 is 0, h8 is 7, a1 is 56, and h1 is 63. Repeat
  this in comments.
- Position: the tuple `(board, white, castling, en_passant)`, plus `halfmove` in
  Remus4. `white` is True when White is to move, the castling rights are four bits
  (1 and 2 for White's kingside and queenside, 4 and 8 for Black's), and
  `en_passant` is the square a pawn just skipped over, or -1.
- Moves: the tuple `(from_square, to_square, promotion)`, with promotion 0 or a piece
  kind.
- The engines read and write only UCI moves (`e2e4`, `e7e8q`), and only at the UCI
  boundary. They hold no SAN and no FEN: Lucas Chess sends `position startpos moves
  ...` for every game.

## Architecture boundaries

| Part | Responsibility |
| --- | --- |
| Native Python engine | Board, rules, moves, search, evaluation, move choice |
| UCI adapter, `uci.py` | `uci`, `isready`, `position startpos moves ...`, `go`, `quit`; only protocol lines on stdout; `bestmove 0000` only with no legal move |
| GUI | Lucas Chess, which starts `remus.bat` and hosts Remus as an external UCI engine |
| Checks | `admin/verify_engines.py`, outside the engines |

The engine must run without Lucas Chess or `python-chess` installed.

## Verification

- Write expected results before running.
- `uv run admin/verify_engines.py` must pass after any engine change: perft
  from six published positions, ten mate puzzles, fixed-depth searches, and a short
  UCI conversation. Compare the fixed-depth node counts and moves before and after a
  change; a change that should not alter the search must leave them identical.
- Start no engine games or matches (any time control) without David's approval
  (David, 2026-11-03). Verify with perft and fixed-depth comparisons instead.

## Project setup

- Remus is a `uv` project on Python 3.14 (`.python-version`, `pyproject.toml`).
  Run `uv sync` once, then `uv run ruff check .`.
- The one runtime dependency is `matplotlib`, for the graphs of the Day 5 science
  programs (David, 2026-11-04); no engine imports it. The `dev` dependency group holds
  `python-chess` (imported as `chess`) and `ruff`. Engine modules never import
  `chess`.
- Lucas Chess is a desktop application, not a Python dependency. It hosts Remus as an
  external UCI engine and comes preinstalled on the class laptops.
- The top `engines_instructor/` folder holds one folder per finished engine,
  `engines_instructor/Remus1` to `engines_instructor/Remus4`, the versions the
  student pairs copy from. Each holds only the files the engine runs
  (David, 2026-11-03): its Python files and `remus.bat` (the one line `uv run uci.py`;
  Lucas Chess starts it in its own folder). Remus3 and Remus4 also hold
  `opening_book.txt`. Each also holds a copy of `verify_remus.py`, so the workshop
  designer can run the student pairs' test on the instructor's engine;
  `make_call_trees.py` skips it and `make_student_engines.py` copies it unchanged. Each engine's `README.md` and `call_tree.svg` live in
  `docs/engines/Remus1` to `docs/engines/Remus4`.
  Each engine names itself in `uci.py` (`id name Remus2`). Modules import each other
  by name (`from board import START_POSITION`), so any module runs from inside its
  folder with the Run button, and nothing in an engine folder imports from another
  folder.
- The top `engines/` folder holds the student pair's own engines (David,
  2026-11-03): four folders, `engines/Remus1` to `engines/Remus4`, each holding only
  `remus.bat` and `verify_remus.py` in the repository. `verify_remus.py` is the
  same file in all four: run with the Run button, it tests the student pair's
  finished version (files, perft, evaluation, a depth-4 search, UCI) against the
  instructor's numbers, which it holds. Update those numbers after any engine change
  that moves them. On Day 1 the student pair creates every
  file of Remus1 in `engines/Remus1`. At the start of Days 2, 3, and 4 it copies every
  file of the previous version's folder into the next one in File Explorer and edits
  those copies. Never put instructor code in `engines/`.
- `engines_student/` holds the code a student pair types, written by
  `uv run admin/make_student_engines.py` from `engines_instructor/`: no shebang,
  docstrings, comments, or type hints, only the `# fmt: skip` comments that keep the
  board tables in shape when VS Code formats on save. Never edit it by hand. It stays
  on David's computer only: git ignores it, so the student pairs cannot copy the
  stripped code from the public repository.
- Each engine README holds a table of its files with their code lines (blank lines,
  comments, and docstrings left out), the call tree picture, and what the version
  adds. `uv run admin/make_call_trees.py` draws the `call_tree.svg`
  pictures from the code; run it after any change to which functions exist or which
  call which. Update the line counts in the READMEs and `remus_versions.md` after any
  code change.
- A module keeps one file name in every version. When a later version makes a file
  smarter, the new code goes into the same file. Never add version numbers to file
  names.
- The top folder holds everything that is not an engine folder (David, 2026-11-04):
  - The plan of the workshop: `workshop_syllabus.md`, the whole week on one page,
    and one top folder per day, such as `Day 1 - Remus1 plays legal chess`, with
    `Day_1_Syllabus.md` and a folder per period (`period1` to `period4`) that
    holds `Day_1_Period_1_Syllabus.md`. The day and period pages follow
    `workshop_syllabus.md`; a change to one goes into the others. Each period
    folder with typed code also holds `images/` (David, 2026-11-04): pictures of
    that code from VS Code, so a student pair cannot paste it, written by
    `admin/make_code_images.py`, and the Day 5 graphs from
    `admin/make_science_figures.py`. Run both after a change to the code they show.
  - `science/`, the two Day 5 programs, `hidden_peak.py` and `phase_hunt.py`, with
    the functions the student pairs write left empty, and `science_instructor/`,
    the finished versions (David, 2026-11-04). This mirrors `engines/` and
    `engines_instructor/`. They follow the engine style (no shebang, copy-make), import
    no engine, and show their graphs with matplotlib: the student pair closes each
    window and the program continues. The student pair types none of the graph code.
  - `docs/`, the pages people read:
    - `docs/engines/`: `Remus1` to `Remus4`, each with its `README.md` and
      `call_tree.svg`, and `remus_versions.md`.
    - `docs/lucas_chess/`: `lucas_chess_guide.md` and its pictures.
    - `docs/chess_tutor/`: `learn_chess.md` (the rarer rules and chess
      notation, with its board pictures in `images/`), `uci.md`, and the minimax,
      negamax, and alpha-beta videos page.
    - `docs/briefs/`: the one-page management brief and the one-page student
      and parent brief, as PDFs.
  - `admin/`: the workshop designer's scripts, with a `README.md`. Every workshop
    designer tool lives here, finds the top Remus folder from its own path, and
    runs from the top folder with `uv run admin/<name>.py`. List every script in
    `admin/README.md` with what it does (David, 2026-10-28). Git ignores
    `admin/` (David, 2026-11-04): it stays on David's computer only, and no
    public page links to it.
- David keeps a snapshot of the workshop before the Remus engines in
  `.archive/` at the top of his Remus folder (David, 2026-11-03). Git ignores it.
  Never edit or delete it.
- **Say "student pairs"** (David, 2026-10-29). The students work in pairs, and every
  document and comment names them "student pairs" or "the student pair", never a bare
  "pairs". A pair of games or a `(row, col)` pair keeps its plain word.

# Part 2: Python style

## General principles

- Code should be **clear, explicit, and readable**.
- Prefer **teaching-oriented explanations** over compact or clever code.
- Write as if the reader is a **student learning the concept for the first time**.
- Avoid unnecessary abstraction unless it improves understanding.

## Script and module structure

Every engine file starts with a docstring whose first line is the filename. A longer
docstring adds a blank line and a short description of what the file teaches or does.
Engine files carry no shebang (David, 2026-11-03): students and teachers run them with
VS Code's Run button, which uses the project's `.venv` that the workspace file selects.

```python
"""search.py

Pick a move by looking ahead with alpha-beta search.
"""
```

A workshop designer script in `admin/` starts with the shebang line
`#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run` above its docstring, so on Linux and macOS a script marked
executable runs with the project's environment and no manual activation.

The parts of a file come in this order:

1. Filename docstring (a designer script puts its shebang above it).
2. Imports, standard library first, then the project's own modules, each group sorted
   (ruff's `I` rule enforces the order). Engine modules import only the standard
   library and each other.
3. Module constants in `UPPER_CASE`, each with a comment that says what it means, such
   as `MATE_SCORE = 100_000  # Larger than any material count`.
4. Functions, simplest first, so a reader meets each helper before the code that calls it.
5. In `uci.py` and in each designer script, a `main()` function and the guard that
   calls it:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The engine modules other than `uci.py` define functions only and print nothing, so
students type no self-check code. Engine modules import each other, and `uci.py`
imports nearly all of them; a module that printed at import time would send stray
text to Lucas Chess and break the protocol. A designer script prints what it checked
next to the expected answer, so it never runs silently.

## Python code style

### Type hints

- Use type hints for every reusable function and class, in modern Python 3.14 syntax:
  `list[str]`, `tuple[int, int]`, `str | None`, `dict[str, int]`.
- Give complex types a name once and reuse it, such as `Square = tuple[int, int]`, so a
  student reads `Square` instead of a nested bracket expression.
- `main()` and short designer scripts may leave out hints.

### Docstrings

Use **NumPy-style docstrings** for reusable functions:

```python
def square_name(row: int, col: int) -> str:
    """
    Convert board coordinates to an algebraic square name.

    Parameters
    ----------
    row : int
        Board row, where row 0 is rank 8.
    col : int
        Board column, where column 0 is file a.

    Returns
    -------
    str
        The square name, such as "e4".
    """
```

Short helper functions may use a one-line docstring:
`"""Return True if the piece is White."""`

### Names

- Functions and variables use `snake_case` with whole words: `legal_moves`,
  `captured_piece`, `halfmove_clock`. Abbreviate only where chess itself does (`fen`,
  `san`, `uci`, `pv`).
- Booleans read as yes-or-no questions: `is_sorted`, `in_check`, `swap_needed`.
- Loop variables may be short where the meaning is plain: `row`, `col`, `i`. Never use
  `l`, `O`, or `I` as a name.
- Do not shadow built-in names such as `sum`, `list`, `max`, or `input`.

### Idioms used throughout

- f-strings for all output. Self-documenting `f"{moves=}"` is fine in quick
  checks.
- Thousands separators make counts readable: `197_281` in code and `f"{nodes:,}"` in
  output.
- `time.perf_counter()` for timing, reported as `f"Total run time (sec): {elapsed:.3f}"`.
- Seed the random generator (`random.seed(2016)`) wherever a check must give the
  same result on every run.
- Plain loops over clever one-liners, everywhere in the repository (David,
  2026-10-27). Simple code for student readers matters more than the most
  Pythonic or the fastest form, and every file follows the same rule:
  - Build text with `+` or `+=` in a loop, never with `str.join()`.
  - Find the best item with a loop that remembers the best so far, never with
    `max(..., key=lambda ...)` or `sorted(..., key=...)`. Do not use `lambda` at all.
  - Fill a list with a loop and `append`, never with a list, set, or dict
    comprehension. Check every item with a loop and a yes-or-no variable, never
    with `any()` or `all()` over a generator expression.
  - `min()` and `max()` of two numbers, and `sum()` of a list, are fine.
  - The workshop designer scripts in `admin/` are tools no student reads, so
    they may keep the compact forms.

## Comments

Comments are **functional and explanatory**. They say what a step means in chess or why
the code is written this way, not what the syntax already shows.

- Explain purpose and meaning: `# Row 0 is rank 8, so White pawns move toward row 0`.
- Address the student where a step needs a nudge: `# Try a rook on d4: it has 14 moves`.
- Avoid decorative comments (banner lines, boxes of `#` characters) and comments that
  restate the code (`i += 1  # add one to i`).
- A short comment above a block beats a long comment at the end of a line.

### Present tense only

Comments describe the code **as it stands now**, in the present tense. The reader
sees only the current version, so anything about the code's past is confusing noise.

- **Never refer to a prior version of the code**, an earlier approach, or how the
  code used to behave.
- **Never describe a past mistake or bug**, or frame the current code as a "fix,"
  "correction," or improvement over something that came before.
- Do not use words like *now*, *again*, *still*, *no longer*, *previously*, *used
  to*, or *the old way* to contrast with an earlier state.
- State what the code does and **why it is written this way**, on its own terms. If
  a design choice needs justifying, justify it by the requirement it meets, not by
  the alternative it replaced.

Example: instead of "The king-safety check is the fix: the old filter let a pinned
knight move," write "A move is legal only if the mover's king is not attacked after
the move is made. Testing after the move catches pins, discovered checks, and en
passant captures that expose the king."

## File naming

- Use lowercase `snake_case` for all files, Python and data alike.
- File names should be **descriptive and topic-based**, for example
  `move_generation.py`, `transposition_table.py`.
- No file name holds a space (David, 2026-11-01): `remus_versions.md`,
  `lucas_chess_guide.md`. Join the words of a file name with underscores.

## File input and output

Every file a script reads or writes lives in the same folder as the script, or in a
folder named relative to it. A bare filename resolves against the current working
directory, so the same script run from another folder writes somewhere else. Anchor
the path to the script and pass `file_path` to every call that touches the file:

```python
file_path = Path(__file__).parent / "opening_book.txt"
print(f"Reading {file_path}")
```

Print the full `file_path` rather than the bare name when reporting a save.

Build `file_path` from `Path(__file__).parent`, never from the bare name, and pass
`file_path` itself to every call that touches the file. Computing `file_path` and then
handing the bare name to `open()` looks correct at a glance and silently reads or
writes in the wrong folder.

## No notebooks

Remus is plain `.py` files. The workshop uses no Jupyter notebooks, so
the notebook rules and the `nb_check.py` hook from the course repositories do not
apply here.

## Linting and formatting

`uv run ruff check .` must pass before a commit. The settings in `pyproject.toml` match
the course repositories: ruff's default rules plus `I` (import order), `C4`
(comprehensions), `ISC` (string concatenation), `SIM` (simpler code), and `TCH`
(type-checking imports), with the default line length of 88. `uv run ruff format .`
formats the code.

The code must also show no type errors in VS Code's Pylance. Check an engine with
`uvx pyright engines_instructor/Remus2`. When a function can return `None`, such as `think()` or
`legal_book_move()`, test for `None` before using the result.

## American spelling

Every word in this repository uses American spelling: prose, docstrings, comments,
Markdown, variable and function names, and printed output. Never use British spelling.

- `traveled`, `canceled`, `modeled`, `labeled` (one `l`), not `travelled`,
  `cancelled`, `modelled`, `labelled`.
- `color`, `favor`, `behavior`, `neighbor`, `center`, `defense`, `offense`, `gray`,
  `catalog`, `analyze`, `realize`, `recognize`, `organize`, `judgment`, `toward`,
  `while` (not `whilst`), `among` (not `amongst`).
- Library identifiers keep their own spelling, so `engine.analyse(...)` from
  python-chess stays as the API names it.
- Do not rewrite British spellings inside third-party data, quoted sources, or proper
  nouns.

## Dashes

Never use an em dash, an en dash, a minus sign, or any other long dash character
(U+2013, U+2014, U+2212, and their relatives) anywhere: not in prose, comments,
docstrings, Markdown, or f-strings. Use a colon, a comma, parentheses, or a plain
hyphen-minus (`-`) instead. Write ranges as `5 to 14` or `5-14`, results as `1-0`,
and negative numbers and scores with the ordinary hyphen.

## Editorial and style guidelines

These apply to the workshop text and plan, README, docstrings, comments, and chat replies.

1. **Avoid robotic abstractions and nested clauses.** Prefer direct, active verbs over
   phrasal verbs like "comes with" or "results in." Say who applies a rule or what the
   program counts. Eliminate dangling final pronouns by naming the noun.
2. **Ban conversational filler.** Never open with "It's important to remember that...",
   "Crucially, ...", "Furthermore, ...", "In summary, ...", or "As previously
   mentioned...". Avoid the word "testament." Do not end an explanation with a
   superficial positive summary such as "making it both powerful and flexible." State
   what the code does and stop.
3. **Explain through concrete examples.** Start with the piece, position, square, or
   operation the reader can picture, then name the general principle. Prefer "a knight
   on a1 has two moves, to b3 and c2" to an unexplained rule about edge squares.
   Explain technical terms at first use.
4. **Make references clear.** Repeat a short, specific noun when "it," "this," or
   "that" could refer to two things. Split a sentence that changes subject midway.
5. **Preserve meaning while improving the prose.** Keep numbers, units, and
   qualifications. Do not attribute understanding to a program: describe the operation
   performed or the output recorded.
6. **Read for natural rhythm.** Vary sentence length. Use paragraphs for connected
   explanations, numbered lists for steps, and tables for comparisons. Use bold
   sparingly. Remove closing sentences that only praise the method or repeat the point.
7. **Avoid weak endings and redundancy.** Give a sentence a concrete ending. Remove a
   relative clause that repeats what the main verb already says.

Do not vouch for the text either: words such as `honestly`, `frankly`, `to be fair`,
`plainly stated`, or `it is worth stating that` spend a sentence announcing a sentence.
Give the reason to believe a claim, such as the perft count that confirms it, instead.
