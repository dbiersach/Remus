# Day 5, Period 2: Castling

## Learning objectives

By the end of this period, each pair can:

- State the castling rules: no earlier king or rook move, empty squares between, and no check on the king's path. **Measured by:** Six-position quiz on castling: each pair gets at least five right.
- Update the castling rights after any move. **Measured by:** The castling tests in `test_special_moves.py` pass, including a captured rook.

## The files

New files this period:

- `test_special_moves.py`

Files that grow this period:

- `legal_moves.py`
- `make_move.py`

Functions the pairs write this period:

- `update_castling_rights()` in `make_move.py`

In the `student` folder these functions raise `NotImplementedError` until a pair writes them. In the `instructor` folder they are finished.

## The changes and why

### `update_castling_rights()` in `make_move.py`

Removes castling rights when a king or rook leaves its square, or when a rook is captured on its square. Rights only ever disappear, so `replace()` deletes letters from a string such as "KQkq".

Check the work with the tests: open a terminal in VS Code inside this folder and type `uv run pytest`. To run one file on its own, such as `board.py`, open it in VS Code and click the Run Python File button (the triangle at the top right of the editor).
