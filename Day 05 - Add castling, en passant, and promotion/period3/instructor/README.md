# Day 5, Period 3: En passant and the double step

## Learning objectives

By the end of this period, each pair can:

- Capture en passant on the very next move only. **Measured by:** The en passant tests pass, including the capture that is legal only once.
- Find the square of the pawn an en passant capture removes. **Measured by:** The pair names the removed pawn's square for exd6 (d5) on the printed board.

## The files

Files that grow this period:

- `make_move.py`
- `move_generation.py`
- `test_special_moves.py`

Functions the pairs write this period:

- `en_passant_victim_square()` in `make_move.py`

In the `student` folder these functions raise `NotImplementedError` until a pair writes them. In the `instructor` folder they are finished.

## The changes and why

### `en_passant_victim_square()` in `make_move.py`

Returns the square of the pawn that an en passant capture removes: the capturer's starting row and the landing column. It is the only capture where the victim is not on the landing square.

Check the work with the tests: open a terminal in VS Code inside this folder and type `uv run pytest`. To run one file on its own, such as `board.py`, open it in VS Code and click the Run Python File button (the triangle at the top right of the editor).
