"""move_generation.py

List the moves of the side to move. A move is a tuple
(from_square, to_square, promotion), such as (52, 36, 0) for e2e4
or (12, 4, 5) for e7e8q, where 5 is a queen. The list holds pseudo-legal moves: some
may leave the mover's own king in check, and the search skips those
after it makes them.
