"""install_lucas_engines.py

Add the instructor's Remus1, Remus2, Remus3, Remus4, and Remus4-Rust to the External
engines list of Lucas Chess.

Step 6 of the Day 1 setup runs this file on each class laptop, with Lucas Chess
closed, using the Run button in VS Code. Lucas Chess keeps its list in the file ExtEngines.pk.
This program opens that file, keeps every engine already in it, and adds each engine
that is missing. Each one runs from engines_instructor: Remus1 to Remus4 through
remus.bat, and Remus4-Rust through its own remus4_rust.exe. An engine that already runs
the right file stays as it is, so a second run adds no duplicates. An engine with the
right name and the wrong file gets the right one, which repairs the list after the
Remus folder moves.
