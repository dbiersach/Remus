# Day 1, Period 4: The UCI loop, and Remus1 plays

3:00 to 4:30. Part of [Day 1: Remus1, legal chess at random](../Day_1_Syllabus.md).

## Goal

Remus1 talks to Lucas Chess and plays a random legal move.

## The big picture

The last two files of Remus1 are new files in `engines/Remus1`, like every file of Day 1. With them the engine can play a game.

`search.py` chooses the move. Remus1's choice is as simple as a choice can be: it plays every move on a copy of the board, keeps the moves that leave its own king safe, and picks one of those at random. This is where a move becomes legal: a move is legal only if the mover's king is not attacked after it. On Day 2 the student pair replaces this file's random choice with a real search.

`uci.py` is the engine's voice. Lucas Chess and Remus talk in UCI, the Universal Chess Interface: Lucas Chess sends lines of text such as `position startpos moves e2e4` and `go`, and Remus answers with lines such as `bestmove e7e5`. `uci.py` reads each line, plays the moves of the game on the starting position, asks `search.py` for a move, and prints it.

## What the student pair types this period

| File | New or edited | What it holds | Lines in your file |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `search.py` | New | `think()`: pick a random legal move | 1 to 14 |
| `uci.py` | New | `read_time()` and `main()`, the UCI loop | 1 to 51 |

The instructor's versions are [`engines_instructor/Remus1/search.py`](../../../engines_instructor/Remus1/search.py) and [`engines_instructor/Remus1/uci.py`](../../../engines_instructor/Remus1/uci.py). Copy only the code: no comments, no docstrings, and no type hints. The line numbers on this page count the lines of the student pair's own file.

## The files, line by line

### `search.py`

Create `search.py` in `engines/Remus1`. It has 14 lines when it is done. Line 1 imports Python's `random` module, and lines 3 to 5 import `in_check()`, `make_move()`, and `generate_moves()` from the files typed earlier today.

`def think(position, seconds):` (line 8) builds the list `legal` (lines 9 to 13): for every move, it makes the move on a copy and keeps it only if `in_check()` says the mover's king is safe. `position[1]` is the second part of the position, `True` when White is to move. `return random.choice(legal) if legal else None` (line 14) picks one legal move, or returns `None` when there is none, which means checkmate or stalemate. Remus1 ignores `seconds`; Remus2 uses it to decide how long to think.

### `uci.py`

Create `uci.py` in `engines/Remus1`. It has 51 lines when it is done, and it is the file Lucas Chess runs.

`def read_time(words, name):` (line 8) finds a number in a `go` line, such as the 60000 after `wtime` in `go wtime 60000 btime 60000`, and returns 0 when the name is missing.

`def main():` (line 14) reads Lucas Chess's lines one at a time with `for line in sys.stdin:` (line 16), splits each line into words, and answers by the first word. `print("id name Remus1")` (line 21) gives the engine its name. The `position` branch (lines 25 to 30) starts from `START_POSITION` and plays each UCI move of the game, such as `e2e4` or `e7e8q`, turning its text into a move tuple with `parse_square()`. The `go` branch (lines 31 to 45) works out how many seconds to think from the clock, calls `think()`, and prints `bestmove` with the move in UCI text, or `bestmove 0000` when there is no legal move. `flush=True` sends each answer to Lucas Chess at once instead of holding it back.

Lines 50 and 51, `if __name__ == "__main__":` and `main()`, run `main()` only when `uci.py` itself is started, as Java runs `main` in the class it starts.

## The period step by step

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 3:00 to 3:10 | How Lucas Chess and Remus talk: read [`uci.md`](../../../misc/chess_tutor/uci.md) together. A move is legal only if the mover's own king is not attacked after it. |
| 3:10 to 3:50 | Type `search.py` of `engines_instructor/Remus1` (12 code lines), whose `think()` plays a random legal move, then `uci.py` (44 code lines). Run `uci.py` and talk to it by hand, as in the "Try it" part of `uci.md`. |
| 3:50 to 4:05 | Run `check_my_remus.py` in `engines/Remus1` and fix any file it names until it reports that Remus1 passes every check. Then add `engines\Remus1\remus.bat` to Lucas Chess as "My Remus1" (Part 2 of the guide). A student pair whose engine fails to start uses the "When something goes wrong" table at the end of the guide. |
| 4:05 to 4:30 | Each student plays My Remus1 (Part 4 of the guide). Every move it makes is legal, and nearly every move is bad. |

## Done when

My Remus1 plays a whole legal game in Lucas Chess.
