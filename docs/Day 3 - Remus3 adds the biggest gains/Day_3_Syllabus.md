# Day 3: Remus3

**Goal for the day:** the student pair turns its Remus2 into Remus3 by typing the 193 new lines, then tests it in P4. Each period ends with an engine that plays, because the lines of one period never call a function of a later period.

## The day at a glance

| Period | Time | Title |

| P1 | 8:30 to 10:00 | [Pawn structure, the bishop pair, and the rook table](period1/Day_3_Period_1_Syllabus.md) |
| | 10:00 to 10:30 | Break |
| P2 | 10:30 to 12:00 | [The table, killer moves, and the null move](period2/Day_3_Period_2_Syllabus.md) |
| | 12:00 to 1:00 | Lunch |
| P3 | 1:00 to 2:30 | [The opening book and the clock](period3/Day_3_Period_3_Syllabus.md) |
| | 2:30 to 3:00 | Break |
| P4 | 3:00 to 4:30 | [The principal variation, then test Remus3](period4/Day_3_Period_4_Syllabus.md) |

## Period 1, 8:30 to 10:00: Pawn structure, the bishop pair, and the rook table

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 8:30 to 8:35 | In File Explorer, copy every file of `engines/Remus2` into `engines/Remus3`. |
| 8:35 to 8:45 | Doubled, isolated, and passed pawns, on a position the teacher shows in Lucas Chess. Why two bishops together are worth more than a bishop and a knight. |
| 8:45 to 9:00 | Move `MATE_SCORE` from `search.py` to `board.py`, and add `position_key()` and `move_text()` (8 code lines in `board.py`). |
| 9:00 to 9:55 | In `evaluation.py`, add the rook table, `pawn_terms()`, the bishop pair, and the lines of `evaluate()` that collect the pawns (47 code lines). Run `uci.py`. |
| 9:55 to 10:00 | Swap driver and navigator. |

[`Day_3_Period_1_Syllabus.md`](period1/Day_3_Period_1_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 2, 10:30 to 12:00: The table, killer moves, and the null move

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 10:30 to 10:45 | Why move order matters to alpha-beta, and why the same position appears by many move orders: e4 e5 Nf3 and Nf3 e5 e4 reach one position. The null move: let the opponent move twice; if the side to move still stands above beta, cut off. |
| 10:45 to 11:00 | Type `transposition_table.py` (22 code lines): `store()` and `probe()`. |
| 11:00 to 11:55 | In `search.py`, add the killer moves and the table probe and store, then `has_pieces()` and null-move pruning in `alpha_beta()` (about 52 code lines). Run `uci.py`. |
| 11:55 to 12:00 | Swap driver and navigator. |

[`Day_3_Period_2_Syllabus.md`](period2/Day_3_Period_2_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 3, 1:00 to 2:30: The opening book and the clock

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 1:00 to 1:10 | An opening book is a list of good first moves in UCI text. Copy `opening_book.txt` from `engines_instructor/Remus3` into `engines/Remus3` in File Explorer: it is data, not code, so nobody types it. |
| 1:10 to 1:35 | Type `opening_book.py` (21 code lines): `load_book()` and `book_moves()`. |
| 1:35 to 2:25 | In `think()`, add the aspiration window and the time that grows when the best move changes; in `uci.py`, add `legal_book_move()`, the game's moves, and the hard time limit (about 30 code lines). |
| 2:25 to 2:30 | Change the name line in `uci.py` to `id name Remus3`. |

[`Day_3_Period_3_Syllabus.md`](period3/Day_3_Period_3_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 4, 3:00 to 4:30: The principal variation, then test Remus3

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 3:00 to 3:20 | Add `principal_variation()` and the `pv` of the `info` line (about 13 code lines). Run `uci.py` and send `position startpos moves a2a3` and `go movetime 5000` to `engines/Remus3` and to `engines/Remus2` (1. a3 is in no line of the book, so Remus3 searches): the `info` lines show how much deeper Remus3 searches in the same time, and the line it expects. |
| 3:20 to 3:50 | Run `check_my_remus.py` in `engines/Remus3` until Remus3 passes every check. Then add `engines\Remus3\remus.bat` to Lucas Chess as "My Remus3" and play one round of My Remus3 against My Remus2, two 5-minute games. |
| 3:50 to 4:10 | One round of My Remus3 against Stockfish 1500, two 5-minute games. Each student pair compares the results with Day 2's, and finds one game where Remus3 played a book move. |
| 4:10 to 4:30 | Each student plays My Remus3 (Part 4 of the guide), human against computer, until the end of the day. |

[`Day_3_Period_4_Syllabus.md`](period4/Day_3_Period_4_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## By the end of the day

**Checkpoint:** Remus3 is complete, 535 code lines, and it has played Remus2 and Stockfish 1500.
