# Day 4: Remus4

**Goal for the day:** the student pair types the 159 new lines of Remus4, then tests it in P4.

## The day at a glance

| Period | Time | Title |
| --- | --- | --- |
| P1 | 8:30 to 10:00 | [Draw sense and searching less](period1/Day_4_Period_1_Syllabus.md) |
| | 10:00 to 10:30 | Break |
| P2 | 10:30 to 12:00 | [Static exchange evaluation](period2/Day_4_Period_2_Syllabus.md) |
| | 12:00 to 1:00 | Lunch |
| P3 | 1:00 to 2:30 | [The endgame evaluation](period3/Day_4_Period_3_Syllabus.md) |
| | 2:30 to 3:00 | Break |
| P4 | 3:00 to 4:30 | [The pawn terms, then test Remus4](period4/Day_4_Period_4_Syllabus.md) |

## Period 1, 8:30 to 10:00: Draw sense and searching less

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 8:30 to 8:35 | In File Explorer, copy every file of `engines/Remus3` into `engines/Remus4`. |
| 8:35 to 8:45 | Reminder of threefold repetition and the fifty-move rule. Late move reductions, principal variation search, and futility pruning: three ways to spend less time on moves that are probably bad. |
| 8:45 to 9:55 | The halfmove clock in `board.py` and `make_move.py`, the game history in `uci.py`, then `is_draw()`, the history list, futility pruning, late move reductions, and PVS in `search.py` (about 36 code lines). Run `uci.py`. |
| 9:55 to 10:00 | Swap driver and navigator. |

[`Day_4_Period_1_Syllabus.md`](period1/Day_4_Period_1_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 2, 10:30 to 12:00: Static exchange evaluation

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 10:30 to 10:45 | A capture is good only if the whole exchange on its square wins material: play it out on paper, cheapest attacker first. |
| 10:45 to 11:50 | Type `exchange.py` (36 code lines): `cheapest_attacker()` and `exchange_score()`. In `quiescence()`, add delta pruning and skip the captures that lose material (about 8 code lines). |
| 11:50 to 12:00 | Run `uci.py`. |

[`Day_4_Period_2_Syllabus.md`](period2/Day_4_Period_2_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 3, 1:00 to 2:30: The endgame evaluation

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 1:00 to 1:15 | Reminder of insufficient material. In the endgame the king comes to the center, and the side that is ahead drives the lone king to the edge. |
| 1:15 to 2:25 | In `evaluation.py`, add the endgame king table and the taper that blends the two king tables, mobility, `mating_bonus()`, and insufficient material (about 45 code lines). Run `uci.py`. |
| 2:25 to 2:30 | Swap driver and navigator. |

[`Day_4_Period_3_Syllabus.md`](period3/Day_4_Period_3_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 4, 3:00 to 4:30: The pawn terms, then test Remus4

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 3:00 to 3:30 | Reminder of the rule of the square. In `pawn_terms()`, add the pawn race, rooks on open files, and `king_safety()` (about 35 code lines). Change the name line to `id name Remus4`. |
| 3:30 to 4:20 | Run `check_my_remus.py` in `engines/Remus4` until Remus4 passes every check. Then add `engines\Remus4\remus.bat` to Lucas Chess as "My Remus4". Test it: one round of My Remus4 against My Remus3, then one round against Stockfish 1500, two 5-minute games each. |
| 4:20 to 4:30 | Each student pair compares the results with Day 3's. |

[`Day_4_Period_4_Syllabus.md`](period4/Day_4_Period_4_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## By the end of the day

**Checkpoint:** Remus4 is complete, 694 code lines, and it has played Remus3 and Stockfish 1500.
