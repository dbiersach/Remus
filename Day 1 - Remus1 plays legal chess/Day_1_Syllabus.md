# Day 1: Remus1, legal chess at random

**Goal for the day:** `engines/Remus1` holds Remus1, which knows every rule of chess and plays a random legal move, and the student pair plays it in Lucas Chess.

| | 12:00 to 1:00 | Lunch |
| P3 | 1:00 to 2:30 | [Move generation](period3/Day_1_Period_3_Syllabus.md) |
| | 2:30 to 3:00 | Break |

## Period 1, 8:30 to 10:00: Set up, and the board

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 8:30 to 9:15 | Setup, steps 1 to 6 of the top `README.md`: install Git, VS Code, and `uv`, clone the repository, run `uv sync`, install the extensions, and open `Remus.code-workspace`. This is the only time anyone types a git or `uv` command. |
| 9:15 to 9:30 | The teacher adds the instructor's `engines_instructor/Remus2/remus.bat` to Lucas Chess (Part 2 of the [Lucas Chess guide](../docs/lucas_chess/lucas_chess_guide.md)) and starts it against Stockfish 1500 (Part 4), so the class sees the engine it will build by tomorrow afternoon. |
| 9:30 to 9:40 | Each student pair opens its `engines/Remus1` folder in VS Code. The folder holds `remus.bat`, the one line that starts the engine, and `verify_remus.py`, which tests the finished engine; the student pair types every other file. |
| 9:40 to 10:00 | Type `board.py` (15 code lines): the piece numbers, the starting position, and square names. The reminder before typing: row 0 is rank 8, column 0 is file a, so a8 is square 0 and h1 is square 63. |

[`Day_1_Period_1_Syllabus.md`](period1/Day_1_Period_1_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 2, 10:30 to 12:00: Moves and attacks

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 10:30 to 10:45 | The position tuple and copy-make: `make_move()` copies the board and returns a new position, so no move is ever taken back. Reminder of castling rights, en passant, and promotion. |
| 10:45 to 11:15 | Type `make_move.py` (23 code lines). Run it. |
| 11:15 to 12:00 | Type `attacks.py` (34 code lines): the knight jumps, the eight directions, `is_attacked()`, and `in_check()`. Run it. |

[`Day_1_Period_2_Syllabus.md`](period2/Day_1_Period_2_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 3, 1:00 to 2:30: Move generation

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 1:00 to 1:15 | One function moves every piece but the pawn: a knight or king takes one step, a bishop, rook, or queen slides. Reminder of the castling conditions. |
| 1:15 to 2:20 | Type `move_generation.py` (65 code lines): `add_pawn_move()`, `pawn_moves()`, `piece_moves()`, `castling_moves()`, and `generate_moves()`. Run it. |
| 2:20 to 2:30 | Catch-up. |

[`Day_1_Period_3_Syllabus.md`](period3/Day_1_Period_3_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## Period 4, 3:00 to 4:30: The UCI loop, and Remus1 plays

| Time | Activity |
| --- | --- |
| 3:00 to 3:10 | How Lucas Chess and Remus talk: read [`uci.md`](../docs/chess_tutor/uci.md) together. A move is legal only if the mover's own king is not attacked after it. |
| 3:10 to 3:50 | Type `search.py` of `engines_instructor/Remus1` (12 code lines), whose `think()` plays a random legal move, then `uci.py` (44 code lines). Run `uci.py` and talk to it by hand, as in the "Try it" part of `uci.md`. |
| 3:50 to 4:05 | Run `verify_remus.py` in `engines/Remus1` and fix any file it names until it reports that Remus1 passes every test. Then add `engines\Remus1\remus.bat` to Lucas Chess (Part 2 of the guide). A student pair whose engine fails to start uses the "When something goes wrong" table at the end of the guide. |
| 4:05 to 4:30 | One round of the student pair against their Remus1, two 10-minute games: each student plays one game, one with White and one with Black (Part 3 of the guide). Every move it makes is legal, and nearly every move is bad. |

[`Day_1_Period_4_Syllabus.md`](period4/Day_1_Period_4_Syllabus.md) has the period's goal, the big picture of what the student pair types or edits and why, every file that changes with its line numbers, and how the student pair knows it is done.

## By the end of the day

**Checkpoint:** Remus1 is complete, 193 code lines, and it plays a legal game in Lucas Chess.
